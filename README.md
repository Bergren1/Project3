# Project 3: Snowmelt after wildfires in Northwest Territories 2014

## Intro

The Purpose of this study was to detect changes in seasonal snowcover following the 2014 wildfires around the Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories in Canada in 2014.

## Burn Extent

Using LandSat Imagery, we created a burn area Index for 2014 for september after the fires. Burned areas are indicated in red. THis was created by Mark Broomfield

## Snow Extent

Using TERRA MODIS data, I created a (3-6-7) false color, with snow in red, as well as a NDSI6 snow extent map. This series is taken on the 17th day of July for 2012-2017. The bottom left image of each (01/17/2015) was the first day that the fire would have impacted snow cover.

## Results

Here is a histogram created using MODIS snowcover data. Burned areas are shown in red, while a seperate area (blue) was used as a control. This section was done by Andrew Gibson
